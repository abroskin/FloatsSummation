# FloatsSummation
Simple algorithm for floats summation.

# Details
Effectively works only with not negative values.

Modifies an input vector.

# Algorithm
Creates a heap on input vector.

On each iteration pops two lowest numbers, sums them and push result back to the heap.

# Complexity
Runtime complexity - O(n log n).

Memory complexity - O(1)
